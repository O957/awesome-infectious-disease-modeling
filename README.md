# Awesome Infectious Disease Modeling [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

_A curated list of awesome resources for infectious disease modeling._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> [Mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") can project how [infectious diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_diseases "Infectious diseases") progress to show the likely outcome of an [epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic "Epidemic") (including [in plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_disease_forecasting "Plant disease forecasting")) and help inform [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health "Public health") and plant health interventions. Models use basic assumptions or collected statistics along with mathematics to find [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter "Parameter") for various infectious diseases and use those parameters to calculate the effects of different interventions, like mass [vaccination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination "Vaccination") programs. The modelling can help decide which intervention(s) to avoid and which to trial, or can predict future growth patterns, etc. [^wikipedia_citation]

> This list follows specific scoping guidelines. The **Books** section primarily contains textbooks. **Organizations** is divided into GitHub organizations and non-GitHub organizations. **Researchers** exclusively features researcher GitHub profiles. A **Reading Lists** section was chosen over individual papers, as managing the volume of papers on the topic at hand in a single list in untenable. **Repositories** targets larger work on GitHub and excludes, for example, standalone code for papers. **Datasets** includes only publicly accessible data. **Software** features notable tools, libraries, and frameworks not available on GitHub. **Websites** covers informational sites, news sources, and community hubs. **Educational Resources** includes tutorials, videos, and other learning materials.
