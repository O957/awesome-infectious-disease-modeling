# Awesome Infectious Disease Modeling [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome resources for infectious disease modeling â€” the mathematical and computational study of how infectious diseases spread and can be controlled.

Infectious disease modeling combines epidemiology, mathematics, statistics, and computational science to understand disease transmission dynamics, predict outbreak trajectories, and evaluate intervention strategies.

**Note on Repositories vs. Software**: Throughout this list, **Repositories** sections contain source code hosted on GitHub/GitLab for researchers and developers, while **Software** sections contain downloadable applications and tools for end-users (excluding items already listed in Repositories).
